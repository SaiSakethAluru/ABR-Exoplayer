ABR-Exoplayer
===
This repository contains the codes for the Android App built with [Pensieve](https://github.com/hongzimao/pensieve) based ABR track selection using [Exoplayer](https://exoplayer.dev). This is developed as part of my final year M.Tech project at IIT Kharagpur.

The code in this repository is built on top of the [Media streaming with ExoPlayer codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/exoplayer-intro). If you are looking to get started with Exoplayer, the codelab is a great place to start.
